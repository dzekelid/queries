    searches by lat and lon return all cities within a radius of the provided coordinates.
    Searches with a query return up to 10 cities matching the term, and can be sorted
    by size or distance to a given coordinate. 'smart' ordering can be used to return
    the match(es) with the highest member_count, unless a smaller size match exists
    nearby the given coordinates. Query searches are supported for country but not
